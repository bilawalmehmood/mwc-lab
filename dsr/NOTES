To find source/dest of a SRPacket p, 

p.dest = ID((Address::instance().get_nodeaddr(iph->daddr())),::IP);
p.src = ID((Address::instance().get_nodeaddr(iph->saddr())),::IP);

MALICIOUS NODES:
---------------
* accept and forward route requests correctly, in order to add themselves
  to routes that can be used by other nodes to forward traffic.
* when a node actually wishes to forward traffic through them, they drop all
  packets (do not forward), effectively performing a denial of service attack.
* the monitor is meant to detect these nodes, by hearing that they do not forward
  traffic in a reasonable amount of time.

SELFISH NODES:
-------------
* drop route requests so as to attempt to never get onto a route, so that they
  will never have to forward traffic for anyone.
* perform route requests of their own in order to use other nodes to send their
  own traffic throughout the network.
* the chip economy is meant to detect these nodes who escape getting on routes
  and so cannot be detected by the monitor since they will never be asked to
  forward traffic.
